✈️ AirTicketBookingSystem : 

A Java-based application that finds paths between cities using breadth-first search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm, optionally including intermediate cities. This project simulates a simplified flight network using a graph structure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Find flight paths between cities.
- Ensure one or more intermediate stops between the source and destination.
- BFS traversal for exploring possible paths.
- Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest route.
- Simple adjacency matrix for connectivity.
- Returns direct path only if no intermediate path exists.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used to find any valid path with at least one stopover.
- **Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest route.

## 📦 Requirements

- Java 8 or above
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse
